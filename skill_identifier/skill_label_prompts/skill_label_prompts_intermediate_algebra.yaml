  [TASK]
  You'll be given a math question and a step-by-step solution written by a SLM. Your task is to output:
  (1) <judge> judge here whether the solution is correct or incorrect </judge>
  (2) <reason> if it's incorrect, reason here why the solution is incorrect </reason>,
  (3) <skill> list here what skill(s) should the SLM enhance in order to answer correctly, seperated by commas </skill>.
