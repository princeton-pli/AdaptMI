He wants to get to 1, but he can hop only $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the distance. Each hop tires him out so that he continues to hop $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the remaining distance. How far has he hopped after five hops? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\nResponse: Let's think step by step\n\nKevin hops $1/3$ of the remaining distance with every hop.\n\nHis first hop takes $1/3$ closer.\n\nFor his second hop, he has $2/3$ left to travel, so he hops forward $(2/3)(1/3)$.\n\nFor his third hop, he has $(2/3)^2$ left to travel, so he hops forward $(2/3)^2(1/3)$.\n\nIn general, Kevin hops forward $(2/3)^{k-1}(1/3)$ on his $k$th hop.\n\nWe want to find how far he has hopped after five hops.\n\nThis is a finite geometric series with first term $1/3$, common ratio $2/3$, and five terms.\n\nThus, Kevin has hopped $\\frac{\\frac{1}{3}\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^5\\right)}{1-\\frac{2}{3}} = \\boxed{\\frac{211}{243}}$.\n\nThe answer is \\frac{211}{243}}\n\nQuestion: What is the area of the region defined by the equation $x^2+y^2 - 7 = 4y-14x+3$?\n\nResponse: Let's think step by step\n\nWe rewrite the equation as $x^2 + 14x + y^2 - 4y = 10$ and then complete the square,\n\nresulting in  $(x+7)^2-49 + (y-2)^2-4=10$,\n\nor $(x+7)^2+(y-2)^2=63$.\n\nThis is the equation of a circle with center $(-7, 2)$ and radius $\\sqrt{63},$\n\nso the area of this region is $\\pi r^2 = \\boxed{63\\pi}$.\n\nThe answer is 63\\pi\n\nQuestion: If $x^2+y^2=1$, what is the largest possible value of $|x|+|y|$?\n\nResponse: Let's think step by step\n\nIf $(x,y)$ lies on the circle,\n\nso does $(x,-y),$ $(-x,-y),$ and $(-x,-y),$ (which all give the same value of $|x| + |y|$),\n\nso we can assume that $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0.$\n\nThen $|x| + |y| = x + y.$  Squaring, we get\n\n\\[(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 1 + 2xy.\\]\n\nNote that $(x - y)^2 \\ge 0.$\n\nExpanding, we get $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \\ge 0,$ so $2xy \\le x^2 + y^2 = 1.$\n\nHence,\\[1 + 2xy \\le 2,\\]which means $x + y \\le \\sqrt{2}.$\n\nEquality occurs when $x = y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}},$\n\nso the maximum value of $|x| + |y|$ is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{2}}.$\n\nThe answer is \\sqrt{2}\n\nQuestion: If $f(x)=\\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}, abcd\\n\not=0$ and $f(f(x))=x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$, what is the value of $a+d$?\n\nResponse: Let's think step by step\n\nThe condition $f(f(x))$ means that $f$ is the inverse of itself,\n\nso its graph is symmetrical about the line $y = x$.\n\nWith a rational function of this form, we will have two asymptotes:\n\na vertical one at $x=-d/c$ if $cx+d$ does not divide $ax+b$,\n\nand a horizontal one at $y=a/c$,\n\nif we take the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ goes to $\\pm\\infty$.\n\nIn order for $f$ to be its own inverse, the intersection of the asymptotes must lie on the line $y=x$\n\nso that it and its asymptotes reflect onto themselves.\n\nThis means that $-d/c=a/c$,\n\nand therefore $-d=a$ and $a+d=\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe answer is 0\n\nQuestion: Expand $(2z^2 + 5z - 6)(3z^3 - 2z + 1)$.\n\nResponse: Let's think step by step\n\n$$\\begin{array}{crrrrrrr}\n\n& & & 3z^3 & & -2z & + 1 & \\\\\n\n\\times & & & & 2z^2 & +5z & -6 \\\\\n\n\\cline{1-7}\\rule{0pt}{0.17in}\n\n& & & -18z^3 & & +12z & -6 & \\\\\n\n& & +15z^4 & & -10z^2 & +5z & & \\\\\n\n+ & 6z^5 & & -4z^3 & +2z^2 & & & \\\\\n\n\\cline{1-7}\\rule{0pt}{0.17in}\n\n& 6z^5 & +15z^4 & -22z^3 & - 8z^2 &+17z & -6 &\n\n\\end{array}$$\n\nThe answer is 6z^5+15z^4-22z^3-8z^2+17z-6\n\nQuestion: What is $10.0000198\\cdot 5.9999985401\\cdot 6.9999852$ to the nearest whole number?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "level": "Level 3", "solution": "Notice that $10.00001988$ is very close to $10$, $5.9999985401$ is very close to $6$ and $6.9999852$ is very close to $7$.
